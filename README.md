# Tag Concierge PrestaShop Module Free
This extension pushes standard eCommerce information – **GA4 Commerce and UA Enhanced eCommerce compatible** – to GTM Data Layer. Once this information is available in your GTM workspace you can plug in and use any tool available, even if you are unsure which tool you need or would like to use.

GTM setup can be cumbersome and time-consuming – this extension comes with packaged presets for 4 main tools in the market that allow you to set up and run the integration in few simple steps without creating every single GTM Variable and Trigger yourself.

Tag Concierge integrates your PrestaShop shop with a GTM container. It can work with existing GTM installation and allows injecting the GTM snippets in the settings.

The extension starts to work without any additional installation. Once it is activated and GTM is embedded in the website, it starts to emit eCommerce events to the GTM dataLayer. Those events are compatible with the newest GA4 format but can be adapted to different tools, including UA and Facebook Pixel.

From there, virtually any integration can be achieved through GTM and the same data from your shop can be sent out to any analytical or optimization tool.
But to make it easier, the extension comes with **packaged GTM presets** that can be imported into GTM workspace to enable dataflow to specific tool in few simple steps without creating every single GTM Tag, Variable, and Trigger manually.

That’s it. With the help of the extension and packaged presets, you can start analyzing and optimizing your PrestaShop shop in almost no time.
